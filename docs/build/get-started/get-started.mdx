# Get Started with Kaia

Welcome to Kaia! Whether you're new to blockchain development or experienced with EVM chains, this guide helps you build on Kaia quickly. We'll walk you through setup, tools, and your first projects step by step.

Follow this goal-based path to go from zero to deploying your first smart contract or dApp. Each step builds on the last, so start at the beginning or jump to what you need.

Get a high-level overview of Kaia and the essentials to begin building.

### Quick Overview
Kaia is an EVM-compatible blockchain designed for speed, security, and scalability. It uses the Kaia Virtual Machine (KVM), which is fully compatible with Ethereum tools and supports Solidity smart contracts. If you're coming from Ethereum, you'll find the transition straightforward--most of your existing code and workflows will work with minimal changes.

For more details on Kaia's architecture, check out [Why Build on Kaia](../../learn/why-kaia.md) and [Consensus Mechanism](../../learn/consensus-mechanism.md).

### Kaia Networks
Kaia has two main networks:
- **Kairos Testnet**: For testing and development. Chain ID: 1001. Use it to experiment without real costs.
- **Mainnet**: For production. Chain ID: 8217.

Configure your wallet or tools with these RPC endpoints:
- Kairos: https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io
- Mainnet: https://public-en.node.kaia.io

Explore blocks and transactions on [Kaiascan](https://kaiascan.io/) (Mainnet) or [Kairos Kaiascan](https://kairos.kaiascan.io/).

### Development Tools
Kaia supports popular Ethereum tools with some extensions for its features. Key resources:
- **[SDKs](../../references/sdk/sdk.md)**: Use [ethers-ext](../../references/sdk/ethers-ext/getting-started.md) (extension of ethers.js), [web3js-ext](../../references/sdk/web3js-ext/getting-started.md), or others for interacting with the network.
- **[Public RPC Endpoints](../../references/public-en.md)**: Access via Public RPC Endpoints.
- **[Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity)**: Write contracts in Solidity--Kaia is fully compatible.
- **[Kaia Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.kaia.io/)**: An interactive generator to bootstrap your smart contract and learn about Kaia Contracts.
- Other tools: [Remix IDE with Kaia Plugin](https://ide.kaia.io/), [Hardhat](https://v2.hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started), [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/), and [Thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/).

<h2 id="step-2-set-up-wallet--network">Step 2: Set Up Wallet & Network</h2>

Choose a wallet like Kaia Wallet or MetaMask, add the Kaia networks, and create an account.

<h2 id="step-3-get-test-kaia">Step 3: Get Test KAIA</h2>

Fund your wallet with testnet KAIA from the faucet to cover gas fees during development.

<h2 id="step-4-hello-world-with-remix">Step 4: Hello World with Remix</h2>

Deploy a simple "Hello World" contract using Remix IDE. We'll use the KaiaGreeter sample as your first contract.

[KaiaGreeter](../smart-contracts/token-development/samples/kaiagreeter.md)

<h2 id="step-5-create-your-first-token">Step 5: Create Your First Token</h2>

Build and deploy a soulbound token (non-transferable NFT) using Hardhat. This covers project setup, testing, and deployment.

<h2 id="step-6-build-your-first-dapp-on-kaia">Step 6: Build Your First dApp on Kaia</h2>

Create a full-stack dApp using Scaffold-ETH 2 on Kaia. This tutorial guides you through setting up the development environment, configuring Hardhat for Kaia, deploying and verifying smart contracts, and building a React frontend with Next.js for seamless integration.

<h2 id="step-7-build-a-mini-dapp">Step 7: Build a Mini dApp</h2>

Integrate Web3 features into platforms like LINE using Unity or Cocos. Great for reaching non-crypto users.

## Next Steps
- Dive deeper with [Tutorials](../tutorials/tutorials.md) for practical examples.
- Learn secure practices in [Secure Wallet Management](../wallets/wallet-config/create-and-manage-wallets-securely.md).
- Explore the full docs for advanced topics like [transactions](../../build/transactions/transactions.md), [smart contracts](../smart-contracts/smart-contracts.md), and [nodes](../../nodes/nodes.md).
