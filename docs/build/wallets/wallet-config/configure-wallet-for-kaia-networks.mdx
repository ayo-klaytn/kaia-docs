# How to configure your wallet for Kaia Networks

## Introduction

This guide provides practical, step-by-step instructions for configuring leading software wallets—Kaia Wallet and MetaMask—to connect to the Kaia Mainnet and Kairos Testnet. This guide is designed for developers who have basic familiarity with crypto wallets and networks, and need to get set up for building or testing on Kaia.

You’ll learn both the fastest and manual ways to add Kaia networks, and how to fund your wallet with testnet KAIA.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts (wallets, networks, transactions)
- Chrome or compatible browser installed
- Understanding of testnet vs mainnet concepts

## Configure Kaia Wallet for Kaia <a id="configure-kaia-wallet-for-kaia"></a>

[Kaia Wallet](../overview/kaia-wallet.md) is the native browser extension wallet for the Kaia ecosystem. While it shares many features with MetaMask, it is optimized for Kaia by supporting unique transaction types, fee-delegated transactions, and the account system specific to the network and offers a seamless user experience on the network.

### Add accounts in your wallet 

When you create your Kaia wallet, you will be given a Secret Recovery Phrase, and an account is automatically generated. You'll see that as your default account when you start your wallet as seen in the *Create a wallet* section.

In certain scenarios, you might want to create and manage multiple accounts. This process can easily be achieved simply by adding more accounts within Kaia Wallet.

> Note that once you add an account, you cannot permanently delete it. It will exist on the blockchain forever. 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Browser" label="Browser Extension" default>

  </TabItem>

### Backup seed phrase securely

Your seed phrase is the master key to your Web3 wallet. It allows you to create and recover your wallet, including every account generated within it. Each account tied to the seed phrase has its own private key, but the seed phrase gives access to all of them — such as *Account 1*, *Account 2*, and *Account 3*

If you only have the private key for one account, you will not be able to access the others. This makes your seed phrase the single most important piece of information to back up securely.

**What to Do**

- **Write it down and store it safely**: Handwriting your seed phrase protects it from online theft. Avoid storing it on any device connected to the internet.
- **Double-check your writing**: Confirm that every word is spelled correctly and in the exact order provided.
- **Store it offline**: A physical backup reduces exposure to hacking or accidental deletion.

**What to Avoid**
- **Do not leave it in plain sight**: Avoid obvious spots like a note on your desk or taped to your laptop.
- **Do not store it in digital locations**: Cloud services, email drafts, or notes apps are vulnerable to hacking.
- **Never share it with anyone**: No one, including Kaia Wallet Support, should ever ask for your seed phrase.
- **Do not change the order of the words**: The sequence matters. Any change will make the phrase invalid.

If, for some reason you forgot to back up your seed phrase or misplaced the original copy, and your Kaia Wallet is still unlocked, you can still view your *Recovery Phrase* using your password. Be sure to record it immediately and store it somewhere safe. 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Browser" label="Browser Extension" default>
    1. Click the **settings** icon at the top right of your wallet.
    ![](/img/build/wallets/be-kw-settings.png)
    2. Select **Reveal Recovery Phrase** in the settings options.
    ![](/img/build/wallets/be-kw-reveal-srp.png)
    3. Enter your password and click **Proceed**
    ![](/img/build/wallets/be-kw-password-for-reveal-srp.png)
    4. Store your revealed seed phrase securely 
    ![](/img/build/wallets/be-kw-reveal-rp-ii.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Mobile" label="Mobile">
    1. Click the **settings** icon at the bottom right of your wallet.
    ![](/img/build/wallets/kw-ma-settings-icon.jpg)
    2. Select **Check the recovery phrase** in the settings option. 
    ![](/img/build/wallets/kw-ma-check-srp.jpg)
    3. Enter your passcode

## Connect MetaMask to Kaia <a id="connect-metamask-to-kaia"></a>

MetaMask is one of the most widely used browser-based wallets in the EVM ecosystem. Its compatibility with Kaia's address structure makes it a popular choice for developers who work across multiple EVM-compatible chains. This chapter will show you how to configure it specifically for Kaia.
