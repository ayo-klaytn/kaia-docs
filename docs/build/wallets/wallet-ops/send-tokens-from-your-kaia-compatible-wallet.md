# How to send tokens from your Kaia Compatible Wallet

This article provides a step by step guide to sending KAIA (native token) and ERC20 tokens using Kaia Compatible wallets such as Kaia Wallet and MetaMask. However, the process is essentially the same regardless of the network (Kaia Mainnet or Kaia Kairos Testnet) you're using — just make sure you have enough of the network's native token to pay for the transaction.

What you’ll need:
- The recipient’s account address
- A sufficient balance of the network's native token (KAIA) in your account to cover gas fees.
