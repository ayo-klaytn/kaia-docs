Kaia Wallet is a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet, meaning that it generates a hierarchical tree-like structure of private/public keys indefinitely from a single seed phrase. The seed phrase consists of mnemonic code words, which makes it easier to remember than phrases made of random alphanumerics. Users' private keys are encrypted and stored in their browsers.

With the features described above, Kaia Wallet has improved the security, transparency, and user-friendliness of the current blockchain experience. However, it is vital for users to be responsible for managing their personal accounts. For example, if a user couldn't remember his/her seed phrase, there would be no other way to restore his/her accounts.
